This project was developed using Perforce so this github repo is just a copy to store the project, so it wasnt actually developed here.


## Group project
This game is the end result of a group project in DAE, we were with 5 students: 2 programmers and 3 artists.\
I was responsible for a big part of the programming.\
I programmed:
- The chickens
- The boss
- The boulders
- The items
- The player spawn system
- The UI
- The menu
(basically everything besides the players, item pickups, player interaction and the berry bush)

## The project
This was made in UE 5.1 and we only C++ for the gameplay logic. It was prototyped, designed and developed in only 12 weeks in a single course.
